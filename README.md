# Foundations-of-Distributed-and-Large-Scale-Computing-Optimization
This folder contains the homeworks of the course "Foundations of Distributed and Large Scale Computing Optimization"

## Goals of the course:

In a wide range of application fields (inverse problems, machine learning, computer vision, data analysis, networking,...), large scale optimization problems need to be solved.

The objective of this course is to introduce the theoretical background which makes it possible to develop efficient algorithms to successfully address these problems by taking advantage of modern multicore or distributed computing architectures. This course will be mainly focused on nonlinear optimization tools for dealing with convex problems. Proximal tools, splitting techniques and Majorization-Minimization strategies which are now very popular for processing massive datasets will be presented. Illustrations of these methods on various applicative examples will be provided.
